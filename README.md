Droid OPS stands for Design, Research, Optimize, Implement, and Deliver. It seems like you have a team structure in place where each department or team member is responsible for a specific step in the process.

The process starts with Hard Magic, which designs the product or service idea. Then the idea goes to the Research Deck, where research is done to analyze the market, figures, and data to determine if the idea is feasible and successful. After that, the idea goes to Northern Arc, where it is optimized based on the research and analysis conducted.

The fourth step is the Implementation, which is done by JIVVA, who builds the project and brings it to life. After the product or service is implemented, it goes to Java, who tests and does the quality assurance (QA) of the product. If any changes are required, it goes back to the respective department for improvement.

It seems like the Droid OPS concept is being used in a cyclical manner, where each step is continuously improving and refining the product or service. The process seems to follow the lean methodology rather than the waterfall model, where there is continuous improvement and checking at every stage.
# Droid OPS Concept in V
Droid OPS is a tech-based concept that can bring success to any business or project. It stands for Designed, Researched, Optimized, Implemented, and Delivered. In V, this concept is used to improve and deliver products and services. The following are the different departments involved in the Droid OPS cycle:
Hard Magic
The Hard Magic department is responsible for receiving an idea and designing it. This involves conceptualizing the product or service and creating a blueprint for its development.

## Research Deck
The Research Deck is the second point of Droid OPS and is where research is conducted on the idea. This includes market analysis and feasibility studies to determine the potential success of the product or service.

## Northern Arc
The Northern Arc department is responsible for optimizing the idea using research analysis and mapping. This involves identifying potential areas for improvement and making necessary changes to increase the product or service's potential success.

## JIVVA
The JIVVA department is responsible for implementing the idea and producing the product or service. This involves executing the blueprint created by the Hard Magic department and ensuring that the product or service meets the desired specifications.

## Java
The Java department is client-facing and is responsible for showcasing the product or service created by the JIVVA department. They act as the point of contact between the client and the development team and ensure that the client's needs are met.

## QA
The QA department is responsible for testing the product or service created by the JIVVA department. They identify any issues or bugs and work with the development team to make any necessary changes to ensure that the product or service meets the desired standards.

The Droid OPS cycle follows the lean methodology, where improvement is made with every step. It's not just a waterfall process, where the product starts and ends without any in-between checks. After every step, the product is improved based on the analysis and research done.

The cycle starts with Hard Magic, where an idea is designed. Then it moves to the Research Deck for research and feasibility studies. After research, Northern Arc optimizes the idea, and then JIVVA implements the idea and produces the product. If any changes are required, the product goes through the cycle again, starting from Hard Magic.

This process involves mapping, research analysis, and optimization to ensure a successful product or service delivery.
